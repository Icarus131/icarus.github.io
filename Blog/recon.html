			<h1>The Importance of Recon</h1>

Recon has to be one of the most important and integral parts of cybersecurity or bug bounties. People somewhat tend to understand this, but they do not truly realize its importance. Recon isn't just a process to find out what you can hack. It can open pathways to show you how you can hack a certain endpoint. Apart from discovering new endpoints, you will discover the web technologies that certain endpoints are using. These web technologies can later be tested and exploited. Another important advantage that recon gives a hacker is its ability to gather a large amount of data in a relatively short amount of time. That is, if you are automating it. Let's take an example of subdomain enumeration. This is something that every noob that tries to hack a website does. Now, the possibilities after you get hold of the subdomains are endless. This is because these subdomains can be compiled into a list and instead of opening each subdomain, we can automate information mining on each subdomain. And generally there are more subdomains than we can manually gather information about in a day. Recon also helps to streamline work. If recon is done properly, we can find vulnerabilities much quicker rather than poking an already saturated endpoint. As an example, finding outdated JIRA configurations can get you a good bounty at times. If we do a mass scan of the subdomains and filter for subdomains with the keyword 'JIRA', we will be able to easily evaluate the JIRA version running and report it if it has been plagued by a CVE. Recon also helps in streamlining all the information that we have gathered. It keeps everything in an ordered manner, which makes it easier to read and understand said information. A clear head is always going to give you an advantage. Keeping organized folders and text files with the appropriate recon for each website/endpoint makes it easier to continue hacking after breaks. This also helps avoid burnout. Finally, recon also helps by facilitating a plethora of automation options. It's almost routine for me to gather subdomains and run an XSS Scanner to see if I can find something. Even a param scanner can search for text fields that maybe vulnerable to cross site scripting or SQL injection. All this just increases your chances at finding more vulnerabilities. Have fun, and remember: Hack the Planet!
