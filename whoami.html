			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<br>
			<p style="line-height: 2">As mentioned, my name is Anirudh and my hacker handle/pseudonym is Icarus. I'm a 17 year old programmer and ethical hacker. Yeah it sounds cringe, and you're probably thinking that I'm a script kiddie at this point. It's your right to do so. I mean after all, Mr.Robot is my favourite show. Although, it's completely justified as the show has stunning cinematography and bold framing choices. And not to mention the hacking scenes are reasonably accurate. My other favourite shows mainly include Sillicon Valley and Breaking Bad. Other than that, I'm quite good at networking, web app pentestingand I dabble in bug bounties. My favourite language is python. I use arch btw, on my main rig that was built by me which has an RTX2070s and an i7-10700k CPU. On my laptop I do still use arch but with the blackarch repository enabled. Arch is quite a stable distro and much more daily drivable than any other pentesting distro that exists. And about the bloat caused by the tools, I really do not care, as the only crank-yankers that complain about bloat are the ones on i3wm with 3000 themes and wallpapers that they never use. Sometimes when I turn off my computer, I realize: "I am completely alone". I lead myself into this. It's a choice. I might feel bad, but I never regret.I believe that the history of humanity is a book written in blood, and that we are all essentially just animals in a pit. This stands to be one of my personal beliefs and I would not enforce this as much as my previous beliefs. Another such belief is the art of abstraction. I always find myself thinking that we can never truly know a person. This is something everyone has thought of in their lives. But diving deeper into thatthought led me to manage myself in a very unorthodox way. I’m firmly under the belief that we should never open our flood gate of information. This means that we should ration how we let out information to the people around us. I maintain myself in such a way that I exist as an abstraction. When someone thinks of me, all that they should be able to deduce is my work and what I do. By this I mean that when people think of me, all thatshould pop up in their mind is: “ Ah, he’s that programmer and ethical hacker. Nice guy”. Anything else like personal experiences with me, my interests,my likes and dislikes should only pop up in their mind if I allow it. This helps to reduce social pressure, and helped me achieve my goals,mature and grow as a person. After realizing all this, I was at my peak. Nothing else mattered except my work. I learnt to put myself and my work first. This introduced a paradigm shift in my lifestyle and increased my efficiency.</p>
